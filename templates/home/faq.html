When you are logged in, you should see the menu item Config in the navigation bar at the top of the screen. Click on the Config menu item to display a dropdown menu. Click on the Spot Admin option. It will be the third option on the menu.</span>

                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">From there you can control the spot prices powering all of your services (charts, widgets, mobile apps, product catalog, alerts, etc). You can set a Fixed Value or an Adjustment Value for your spot prices. To override your spot price with a Fixed Value, use the fields Bid and/or Ask for the appropriate metal. For example, to lock your Ask of Gold at a fixed price of $1,215.75, put that value in the Ask field for gold. To apply an adjustment value to your spot price, use the fields for Bid Adjustment and or Ask Adjustment for the appropriate metal. For example, to have your Ask of Gold automatically adjust by ¢50 over the spot price and your bid automatically adjust by the same amount, you would set “Ask Adjustment” for Gold to 0.5 and the “Bid Adjustment” for Gold to -0.5.</span>

                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Enable Spot Price Overrides must be checked and settings saved for any of these values to be applied. To turn these values off and resume the use of the spot price data feed, uncheck the Enable Spot Price Overrides checkbox and save the settings.</span>

                    In order to access the nFusion Solutions APIs, you will be issued one or more API tokens, depending on your use case. These API tokens should be considered a secret, and should not be exposed over the public internet. To that end, API calls should never be made directly in JavaScript such that the code can be inspected in a browser and the API token discovered. Instead of making direct calls to nFusion APIs in client-side code, please use a proxy on your own server.

                    For example, https://yoursite.com/proxy/metals/spot. The nFusion API can then be called from your server-side code and the token will not be exposed.

                    It is also highly recommended that your proxy perform some form of caching so that the ratio of client-side requests for data is not 1:1 with calls to nFusion APIs, as this will boost performance.

                    Moreover, when accessing our data API, some of the following HTTP headers should be added to your API requests, depending on your use cases.
                <ul>
                    <li>Accept
                        <ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The recommended value for this header is “deflate,gzip”. This will result in compressed results that generally have better performance.</li>

                    When your API calls return an HTTP code 403 (forbidden), with sub status 502, your API call has exceeded rate limits.

As of version 2.9.9, our Product Catalog plugin is setting the priority of the aforementioned filter to 10000 in an attempt for our hook to be run last. If the priority of said filter in the currency plugin is higher than 10000, it may be overriding the price that is being returned from the<span> <a href="https://nfusionsolutions.com/product-pricing-catalog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Catalog</a>.</span>

                    <strong>1.</strong> Use our <span><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/precious-metals-chart-and-widgets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress Charts &amp; Widgets Plugin</a></span>

                    As of version 1.2.4, our widgets plugin will work out of the box with any of the aforementioned supported currency switchers

                    <strong>2.</strong> Use our currency helper script

                    The currency helper script is implemented in a very similar fashion to our default widget scripts. You simply need to paste a script into the page where you would like to display the widget. If you would like to use this option, please visit our <span><a href="#elementor-tab-title-7634">tutorial on how to implement the currency helper script</a>.</span>

                    To do this, each widget must have a unique ID so that when they are loaded into the page, there are no javascript errors or conflicts.

                    Therefore, when you are adding multiple instances of the same widget to a single page, you need to change the ID of the DIV element so that it is unique within that page; then, modify the src attribute within the script by adding “/your-id” to the end of the root domain. By changing the ID and modifying the src, you are telling the script which DIV element to load the chart into.

                    For example, here is a default chart widget script that has been copied from the preview page:
                <pre class="desktop-code"><code>&lt;div id='c528ee05-722d-4762-a635-213197f7b8b4' style='width:100%;height:100%;'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;script&gt;
                (function(){
                    var t = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
                    var s = document.createElement('script'); s.async = true;
                    s.src = 'https://widget.nfusionsolutions.com/widget
            /script/chart/1/32796899-2cc3-4454-ac51-2c95c78799af/c528ee05-722d-4762-a635-213197f7b8b4';
                    t.parentNode.insertBefore(s, t);
                })();
            &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
                <pre class="mobile-code"><code>&lt;div id='c528ee05-722d-4762-a635-213197f7b8b4' style='width:100%;
            height:100%;'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;script&gt;
                (function(){
                    var t = document
            .getElementsByTagName
             ('script')[0];
                    var s = document
            .createElement
            ('script'); s.async = true;
                    s.src = 'https://widget
            .nfusionsolutions.com
             /widget/script/chart/1

                    t.parentNode
            .insertBefore(s, t);
                })();
            &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
                Now say you wanted to add another chart on the same page (maybe to change the selected symbol for example). Here is what it would look like to add a second instance of the same widget to a single page:
                <pre class="desktop-code"><code>&lt;div id='my-custom-id' style='width:100%;height:100%;'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    var s = document.createElement('script'); s.async = true;
                    s.src = 'https://widget.nfusionsolutions.com/widget/script/chart/1/32796899-2cc3-4454-ac51-2c95c78799af/c528ee05-722d-4762-a635-213197f7b8b4/my-custom-id';
                    t.parentNode.insertBefore(s, t);
                })();
            &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
                <pre class="mobile-code"><code>&lt;div id='c528ee05-722d-4762-a635-213197f7b8b4' style='width:100%;
            height:100%;'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;script&gt;
                (function(){
                    var t = document
            .getElementsByTagName
            ('script')[0];
                    var s = document
            .createElement
            ('script'); s.async = true;
                    s.src = 'https://widget

                })();
            &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
                Notice how everything is the same except for the DIV element ID and the end of the src attribute.

                <div class="desktop-code">To do this, you must connect the two elements, both the button and the iframe, via javascript. This tutorial will use the example of creating a button that changes the selected symbol of a chart. First, start by adding your desired event listener. In this example, since we are using a button we would add a click event. Once you have added the event listener to the button element, create a function that will manipulate the iframe and call it from within the click event. Now, this function will run every time the button is clicked. Next, you will need to get access to the iframe element. Once you have access, you may then manipulate its attributes. In this example, we will be manipulating the “src”. Once you get the src of the iframe, you simply need to replace or override that src URL with the new desired src URL.For example, a default chart src URL looks like this: “https://widget.nfusionsolutions.com/widget/chart/1/fya3e32-e870-adf20-a9f3-c88c636f7s8d/188e705d-23afa-45dd-fce21-09c8298af4f2”

                    If you want to change the symbol when the button is clicked, the src URL would look like this: “https://widget.nfusionsolutions.com/widget/chart/1/fya3e32-e870-adf20-a9f3-c88c636f7s8d/188e705d-23afa-45dd-fce21-09c8298af4f2?selected=silver”

                    When you replace the src URL in the javascript the chart iframe will then update and display the new src URL.

                    <strong>Below is an example code snippet using jQuery to switch the charts selected symbol to silver:</strong>

                    let button = $(‘.sample-button’) , widget = $(‘#188e705d-23afa-45dd-fce21-09c8298af4f2’);

                    button.click(changeSymbol(widget));

                    function changeSymbol() {
                    widget.children(“iframe”).attr(“src”, “https://widget.nfusionsolutions.com/widget/script/chart/1/6e98ae99-d878-43a2-81f0-a2528bd3d47e/5444e580-e249-426f-b07f-d23c19049c08” + “?selected=silver”);

                                    <li>Catalog API Key</li>
                                </ul>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                In regard to the sales channel, you can either create a new sales channel or use any existing sales channel you would like for this app integration. For example, you could create a sales channel named “Website” that contains all of the products that you want to be available to your nFusion Shopify app. Any products that you want price updates for in Shopify must be tagged with the sales channel you previously choose for this app integration. To add a product to a sales channel, go to the main Product tab and select the icon next to a product SKU. This will then expand that product record and allow you to add/remove products from sales channels. The SKU field for each product in the nFusion Product Catalog must match exactly the corresponding product you want to be updated in Shopify.

                Once you have completed the steps above, your app should be fully integrated with your nFusion Product Catalog.

                    Plugin Setup:
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                        <ul>

                            <li>Go to Plugins menu and Select NFUSION Plugin for WooCommerce</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                &nbsp;

                Once the plugin is installed and activated, navigate to the nFusion Settings within the settings submenu in the WordPress toolbar. Next, fill in the text entry boxes with the required information pertaining to your product catalog. In regard to the sales channel, you can either create a new or use any existing sales channel you would like for this plugin integration. For example, you could create a sales channel named “Website” that contains all of the products that you want to be available to your nFusion WordPress plugin.

                Moreover, any products that you want price updates for must be tagged with the sales channel you choose for this plugin integration. To add a product to a sales channel, go to the main Product tab and select the icon next to a product SKU. This will then expand that product record and allow you to add/remove products from Sales Channels.

                Once you have linked the plugin with your product catalog via the sales channel, go to the Products page in your WordPress/WooCommerce site. Then, add the Product SKU for each product in the nFusion Solutions Catalog Integration section at the bottom of the product pages. This SKU needs to match the product SKU in the nFusion Product Catalog service.

                Once you have completed the steps above your plugin should be fully integrated with your nFusion Product Catalog.

                    Below is a step-by-step process for how to set up eBay integration with the Product Pricing Catalog.
                    <ol>
                        <li aria-level="1">Create a sales channel that will be used to group all products you want to integrate into eBay. You may skip this step if you already have a sales channel you would like to use.</li>
                        <li aria-level="1">Add any product(s) you want to integrate with eBay to the eBay sales channel.
                            <ol>
                                <li aria-level="1">You can add products individually to a sales channel by clicking on the arrow icon to the left of a product’s SKU on the main Products tab. This will expand the row and you can then click on the Sales Channel tab and then click the pencil (edit) icon to add that product to one or more sales channels.</li>
                                <li aria-level="1">You can add All Products to a Sales Channel by clicking on the top navigation Config / Attributes and then scrolling down to the Sales Channel section. From here, pick the Sales Channel you want to add all products to and click the Add All Products button on the right-hand side.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li aria-level="1">Click on the top navigation Integration / eBay then go to the eBay tab in the catalog. Go to where it says “eBay API Authentication Token”. There is a link there “[To issue a new authorization token for your eBay integration click here]”. Click that link and issue a token to nFusion Catalog to allow it to update your eBay listings.</li>
                        <li aria-level="1">Click the link that says “[To refresh your eBay listings manually before the next scheduled interval click here]”. You do not need to do this every time, as it will auto-update once the integration job has been scheduled. If you have any active or scheduled Fixed Price eBay listings they should now appear in the table.</li>
                        <li aria-level="1">Map eBay listings to catalog products. To do this go to each row in the table, click edit, then in the column “Catalog Product” select the SKU of the product to map.</li>
                        <li aria-level="1">Create your eBay listings markups. If markups are applied to eBay listings they are applied to the “retail ask” of that product in the catalog. There are several options for pricing eBay listings:
                            <ol>
                                <li aria-level="2">Apply a markup to the sales channel used for eBay listings. This will apply a consistent markup to all listings (i.e. 10% above retail ask).</li>
                                <li aria-level="2">Apply markup in each row of the eBay listings mapping table. This allows you to specify different markup amounts for each listing.</li>
                                <li aria-level="2">Combine options a &amp; b. Sales channel markups are applied first, then mapping level markups.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li aria-level="2">Once your initial setup is complete notify nFusion Solutions so that your integration can be started.</li>
                        <li aria-level="2">Keep in mind that as you create new listings, or existing listings expire or are renewed (if eBay creates a new listing id) you will need to perform the mapping step again.</li>
                    </ol>
                    A few things to note during this process:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Only Fixed Price listings can be updated on eBay</li>
                        <li>Listings cannot be created in eBay from the catalog, only updated</li>
                        <li>Only the price field is updated on eBay</li>
                        <li>The catalog does not take into account inventory levels</li>
                        <li>Zero prices are not pushed to eBay, they are skipped</li>
                        <li>eBay integration job can not run more often than every 10 minutes. (This is because of limitations enforced by the eBay API)</li>
                        <li>Does not support tiered pricing</li>
                        <li>Only supports US instances of eBay listings</li>
                    </ul>

                    The Product Pricing Catalog (PPC) is a dynamic pricing calculator and product pricing management dashboard that incorporates real-time spot prices, currency rates, unit weight, user-entered markups, and performs on-demand calculations, which are integrated into your e-commerce system via APIs. Our platform allows you to set all of your product pricing exactly how you would like it in your management dashboard and then automatically pull that live dynamic pricing into your website, mobile app, custom invoicing page, ERP, etc.

                    Once logged in to the Product Pricing Catalog (PPC) you will see some demo products already set up. You can use these example products, modify them, or add new products as needed. You can edit a product to adjust the markups and get the pricing exactly how you need it, applying dollar or % values or both. You can set your Ask (sale prices) as well as your Bid (buying prices) in this same view. Keep in mind the product SKU (unique primary key per product) and the Sales Channel are required for product prices to properly update within your E-Commerce software.

                    In addition, the Product Pricing Catalog (PPC) has a series of APIs that you can access once you are logged in. In the upper right-hand corner under your username, there is a dropdown menu that has the API documentation in it. You can also access your PPC API token in this drop-down menu.

                <em>Configurations</em> are default values that are able to be changed and become the new default for that widget. <em>Query string parameters</em> are values that override the default values of the widget on a per widget-instance basis. For example, you can use the same chart multiple times with each instance being different due to <em>query string parameters</em>. Let’s say that the default currency within the widgets <em>configurations</em> is set to USD. By adding a <em>query string parameter</em> to one of the chart instances src URLs we can override the currency to something different for only that instance of the chart.

                <strong>Standard Configurations:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Currency: Changes the default currency to be displayed.</li>
                <li>Unit of Measure: Changes the default unit of measure to be displayed.</li>
                <li>Auto Update: Can be enabled or disabled (enabled by default).</li>
                <li>Update Interval: Changes the interval in which the widget updates the prices.</li>
                <li>Link: When a user clicks within the widget area they would be redirected to the provided URL</li>
                <li>Timezone: Changes the default timezone to be displayed.</li>
                <li>Whitelist URL(s): This controls which URLs the widget is allowed to be displayed on.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Standard Query String Operations/Parameters:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Symbols (?symbols): Changes the symbols that populate the widget. This operation also has the ability to reorganize the order in which the symbols are displayed.</li>
                <li>Currency (?currency): Changes the currency that the prices are displayed in.</li>
                <li>Unit of Measure (?unitofmeasure): Changes the unit of measure that the prices are displayed in.</li>
                <li>Width (?width): Changes the width of the widget iframe.</li>
                <li>Height (?height): Changes the height of the widget iframe.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>Charts:</strong></h3>
            Within our chart widgets, there are two main versions, V1 and V2. The only difference between these two versions is the layout of the chart elements. In regard to functionality, both charts are capable of accomplishing the same tasks. That being said, both versions can support the following configurations and query string operations:

            <strong>Configurations:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Display Navigation Bar: This option allows you to either display or hide the navigation bar at the bottom of the chart. (displayed by default)</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Query String Operations/Parameters:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Selected Symbol (?selected=): Changes the symbol that the chart initially displays.</li>
                        <li>Selected Timeframe (?timeframeindex=): Changes the timeframe that the chart initially displays.</li>
                        <li>Chart Type (?charttype=): Changes the line style that is graphed within the chart area.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            &nbsp;

            <p>Use this interactive demo of our V1 chart to better understand how the query string parameters work:</p>

            <h3><strong>Tables:</strong></h3>
            Within our table widgets, there are six versions, V1 (standard), V2 (carousel), V3(Historical Performance Table), V4 (Annual Historical Performance Table), V5 (Multi-Unit Table), and V6 (Multi-Unit Multi-Currency Table).
            <h4><strong>V1 &amp; V2:</strong></h4>
            Similar to the V1 and V2 charts, the only difference between the V1 and V2 tables is the styling and position of table elements.

            <strong>Configurations:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Table Fields: Displays the selected field(s)
